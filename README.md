##README
This repo contains some of my crude solutions to Leetcode/QJ.

All soulutions can be compiled by MSVS and run seperately with few testing cases.

For windows user, following commonds can be used to simpilzed the compile-run operation: 
<pre>
; using your visual studio commond tool
cd {some solution folder}
../run.bat
</pre>
