##README

This repo contains some of my crude solutions to Leetcode/QJ.

All solutions can be compiled by MSVS and run separately with few testing cases.

###Here list all problems I have solved:

|  #  | Title | Solution | Difficulty |
| --- | ----- | -------- | ---------- |
{% for x in solved %}| {{ x }} | [{{ data.problems[x].name}}]({{ leetcode_uri + data.problems[x].uri }}) | [c++]({{ data.problems[x].dir }}) | {{ difficulty[data.problems[x].difficulty] }} |
{% endfor %}



This list is auto generated by scripts inside 'script' folder.

Hope these can help you more or less.
####Feel free to leave issues or pull-requests if you find any mistakes in my code, thank you.
